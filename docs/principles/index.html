This is why different people in the same classroom often absorb different levels of knowledge from the same teacher or professor.</li></ul><ul id="7250ece5-7d12-4c84-87f1-23e46115a091" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">The one who sees inaction in action, and action in inaction, is intelligent among people; A wise person lets go of all results, whether good or bad, and is focused on the action alone.  In the dark night of all beings awakes to light the tranquil man, but what is day to other beings is night for the sage who sees.</li></ul><ul id="05f43888-8f90-422d-a5cf-3feea54156a1" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">Realize the difference between being hopeful by focusing your efforts/actions towards ambitions and goals <em>versus </em>being attached to or expecting a certain outcome because of your effort/actions. You have the right to perform your prescribed duty, but you are not entitled to the fruits of your actions. The one who is motivated only by the desire for the fruits of their action, and anxious about the results, is miserable indeed.  You should never engage in action for the sake of reward, nor should you long for inaction as inaction is not possible. If you seek refuge in the attitude of detachment of results, you will amass the wealth of spiritual awareness.</li></ul><ul id="13bd7a20-d84d-48d1-8b9e-542bdadbf146" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">A lustful, greedy and selfish attitude is like a dusty mirror which leads to eventual self destruction. A selfish person will fail to perceive the truth when tackling any given situation. A lopsided view will keep them bound by doubts and disappointments. Contentment with what you have is essential. Through selfless service, you will always find the fulfillment and satisfaction.</li></ul><ul id="9df0c802-2fe4-418d-8979-4ea13be3c219" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">One who is not disturbed in spite of the miseries, who is not elated when there is happiness, and who is free from attachment, fear, lust, greed and anger, is called a sage of steady mind. That person  who does not rejoice when he obtains good, nor lament when he obtains evil, is firmly fixed in perfect knowledge.</li></ul><ul id="f61279b7-586d-4b90-bd2b-e69c44a8632a" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">You should never abandon duties because you see defects in them. Every action, every activity, is surrounded by defects as a fire is surrounded by smoke.</li></ul><ul id="046290d2-3278-4c9c-9295-c18fade1d1c4" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">Just as parents/teachers/mentors give the nectar of life through love, knowledge, wealth, and more, they also inadvertently pass on the poison of preconceptions of righteous versus evil to their children, students and mentees. The gift of life comes packaged with the gift of death, and the light of love comes with the darkness of hatred through others&#x27; actions and words.</li></ul><ul id="07971c9e-386b-4ae1-ad99-79a88a5f08a8" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">A person is born without any inherent good or bad traits. Building the character of your children, and more importantly yourself, is more paramount than always planning a secure and convenient future for your children and yourself.</li></ul><ul id="ac757445-ad92-4725-ac5d-85b009099e1a" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">Nothing in life is constant; change is the rule of life in this world and often not according to one&#x27;s wishes or desires, which presents various difficulties. Just like a mountaineer climbing a mountain faces unanticipated challenges and must revise their plan multiple times, everyone faces different obstacles at different phases of their life. Therefore, rather than making your life worthy of you, make yourself worthy of this life.</li></ul><ul id="5fc54eb0-17b7-47e6-b255-485aee8a1aa5" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">Crises and powerful remedies for crises are born together for a person and the world.

You can be a million times good, but if your circle of influence is bad, you will be doomed. However, if you are a million times bad and spend time with virtuous and ambitious people and listen to them, you will surely be eventually uplifted.</li></ul><ul id="7d434c9b-e0b7-4e46-806e-71bbf9ed1ebc" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">Incomplete knowledge or blind faith in any one person or belief is the most dangerous among all modes of knowledge.</li></ul><ul id="a02eed7e-65da-45b9-aa14-519708a92644" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">It is possible to become the best in a domain for a limited period, but no one is the best forever. This usually leads to eventual dissatisfaction. Instead of becoming the best among all, one should aim to become better than themselves by seeking worthy knowledge through reliable sources and learning only for their own satisfaction and contribution to the world without any comparison to anyone else.</li></ul><ul id="0fd7826e-28de-4820-810d-6a4e3959526f" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">Decisions made when the mind is calm always lead to prosperity, whereas decisions made to calm the mind often leads to regrets in future. Dutiful observance of natural and moral principles of righteous conduct is the basis and source of all long-lasting prosperity. Therefore, it is important to ask whether a decision is according to moral principles of right conduct [Svadharma/Dharma (not to be confused with one’s religion)] or your selfish interests [Swarth].</li></ul><ul id="373932fa-6cae-461b-a568-6db5269c13a5" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">A person who does not follow right conduct often does not have a calm state of mind due to fear and guilt and eventually faces various struggles. In contrast, a person who follows righteous conduct has a calm and satisfied state of mind due to their confidence in the law of cause and effect [as you sow, so shall you reap] and circumstances do not diminish their happiness.</li></ul><ul id="7d66a1a3-e441-47d9-b127-2bfae60aec24" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">Overcoming any kind of fear becomes a lot easier when one realizes that fear is the imagination of anticipated sorrow.

Your thoughts can either make you or break you. If you can think it, you can achieve it.

This eventually leads to backlash, and a lack of fulfillment, struggles, and sorrows in relationships, causing people to attempt to change the other or seperate. This can be avoided by forming relationships on the basis of values of the relationship itself, after self-reflection, without having any expectations, and without attempting to change others. Acceptance of people as they are and respect for each other&#x27;s freedom are prerequisites for establishing long lasting relationships.</li></ul><ul id="6aa18ba4-e080-4a80-9273-a15a3291f0aa" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">The right way of influencing people is not through power or imposing limitations but rather through the virtue of love, sympathy, compassion, and righteousness. Love does not set boundaries but rather accepts people and sets the other person to act freely at all times.</li></ul><ul id="68cae18a-d2fe-4665-8371-1c8e5c728d47" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">Before accepting someone&#x27;s advice or counseling for a situation in one&#x27;s life, it is very important to analyze if it aligns with the dutiful observance of natural and moral principles of right conduct that apply to all beings and things. It is better to live your own destiny imperfectly then to live an imitation of somebody else&#x27;s life with perfection or follow an advice without your own analysis.</li></ul><ul id="4f5d2e5e-ebb4-4da0-b991-1e88bd575e1f" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">There is a very fine line of difference between revenge and justice. The basis of justice is compassion and mercy, whereas the basis of revenge is ego and arrogance. From ego and arrogance arises anger, which destroys intellect.</li></ul><ul id="08eef9c3-20b6-4892-a260-088b2e9e7bf7" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc">Justice is the state when the person who committed the injustice realizes their wrongdoing, and the person who faced the injustice is hopeful for a better future. Revenge is the state where the person seeking justice eventually indulges in wrongdoings in order to punish the person who committed the injustice.
