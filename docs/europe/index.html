By 2019, with my graduation from the <a href="https://www.washington.edu/">University of Washington</a> on the horizon, I had started planning a solo trip through Europe. I even spoke to my recruiter to start my first job a bit later to make this possible. But then, well, COVID-19 happened.  My Europe dreams joined a growing bucket list and instead, I hunkered down, only visited Kerala, India with my school friend, and kept the European dream alive for a future “some day.” Every year, I try to pull one item from my bucket list, especially something outside my comfort zone. This year, I finally took the plunge and planned my first real solo trip to Europe. </p><p id="13a3ab91-7fac-8087-aac5-e1659830a553" class="">

I found the process of elimination very helpful in prioritizing experiences I genuinely wanted, rather than trying to cram everything in from a checklist. For each destination, I created a list of activities in an Excel sheet and labeled each as “Definitely,” “Maybe,” or “No.” I also roughly mapped out dates and times for these activities—not to follow rigidly, but to get a sense of how much time each would require, including commuting between locations. This helped me plan the most efficient order and mode of transport based on time, cost, and the proximity of each spot.</p><p id="13a3ab91-7fac-801c-8c0c-d89ac02cc4b8" class="">GPT-4 was incredibly helpful in this planning process. I didn’t set a strict financial budget because I didn’t want to limit my experiences, but looking back at my transactions, I actually managed pretty well. Interestingly, even after choosing relatively expensive European countries, my spending was thousands less than what GPT estimated when I input my itinerary details.</p><p id="13b3ab91-7fac-80c4-bb05-e00d699f875d" class="">

Each room is grander than the last, and even though no photos were allowed, the experience itself was memorable.

Seeing the Crown Jewels was breathtaking—their historical significance and sheer beauty are almost overwhelming. The Tower itself, with its medieval architecture, served as a fortress, prison, and royal residence, which makes it feel like a living piece of history.

Walking through the Great Hall and seeing iconic locations like Diagon Alley, the Gryffindor common room, Dumbledore’s office, the Hogwarts Express, Hagrid’s hut, the Knight Bus, and the Forbidden Forest felt surreal—like stepping straight into the movie. There are also numerous original costumes worn in the films, plenty of props, detailed information about the people who made the films, and some fun hands-on activities.

Upon arrival, the city greeted me with heavy rain and wind for the first two days, but that was perfectly fine since I spent most of that time socializing with my teammates at Tesla, Inc., who work at the Amsterdam office.

The rooms, preserved with the sparse furnishings and marks of a life in hiding, brought her story to life. Standing in the room where Anne wrote her diary, which I had read a few years ago, I was overwhelmed by the poignancy of her words and the strength of her spirit. The displays provide incredible context, and the experience offered a powerful reminder of resilience and hope in the darkest of times. It’s a must-visit for anyone wanting to connect with history on a deeply personal level, and I left with a lasting sense of the importance of preserving her legacy.

It’s almost like stepping back in time with the charming windmills, historic wooden houses, and artisanal workshops lining the Zaan River. I loved wandering through the village and visiting a working windmill, watching it churn as it once did centuries ago. The smell of freshly ground spices wafting from the spice mill added an incredible sensory layer to the experience.

I’ve always been fascinated by the stunning pictures I’ve seen online and on TV growing up. In fact, during the planning phase, I almost considered just spending two weeks in Europe—one week for Switzerland (for the activities and views) and the other for Italy (for food and history). I had allocated the most time 11 days to Switzerland of all the places in my trip.</p><p id="13b3ab91-7fac-80dd-8651-c90170aab209" class="">

They decided to <em>prepone</em> the departure time without bothering to notify anyone. So, when I reached Amsterdam Centraal, I was greeted by the unpleasant surprise that the train had already left—even though my ticket still showed the original schedule. And no, re-downloading it didn’t help. I wasn’t alone in this mishap; a few other travelers were also stuck in the same boat. Initially, it was overwhelming, but the customer support desk at the station was surprisingly helpful, directing me toward an alternative route that involved two overnight train changes in Germany. Sometimes, it’s these unexpected twists that make the journey unforgettable—because let’s be honest, smooth sailing doesn’t always make for the best stories!</p><ul id="13a3ab91-7fac-801b-97bf-d3f39de5f0c5" class="bulleted-list"><li style="list-style-type:disc"><strong>Lucerne</strong>: Ranked as one of Switzerland&#x27;s most beautiful cities, Lucerne was a must-visit for me.

I was stuck in a last-minute decision between Zurich and Lucerne—until I stumbled upon this amazing <a href="https://airbnb-luzern.ch/">backpacker’s homestay</a> that had views to die for. Sure, it was a bit pricier than other options, but the vibes were so good I couldn’t resist. Plus, they let me check in <em>seven hours early</em>—probably because they felt bad hearing I missed my sleeper train and had to change trains overnight.<p id="13a3ab91-7fac-800f-8f96-c02f5cb9fb45" class="">Once I settled in, I got to explore the iconic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Lucerne">Lake Lucerne</a>, <a href="https://www.myswitzerland.com/en-us/experiences/chapel-bridge-and-water-tower/">Chapel Bridge,</a> and took a trip to nearby <a href="https://www.stoos.ch/en/">Mount Stoos</a>.

Getting there is a thrill in itself: you take the world’s steepest funicular, which climbs a shocking 110% gradient. No, that’s not a typo. Once at the top, I tried the <a href="https://www.alltrails.com/trail/switzerland/schwyz/stoos-fronalpstock-klingenstock">Fronalpstock Panorama Trail</a>, which promises 360-degree views of the Alps. However, due to snowy conditions, I decided to call it quits on the trail. Even other hikers with spikes on their shoes were getting cold feet. One hiker said, “Mistakes are good, as long as they’re not deadly.” Wise words, my friend. Still, the views from Stoos were breathtaking—Lake Lucerne shimmering below, surrounded by green meadows dotted with chalets, cows, and wildflowers. It was like walking through a Swiss postcard.

Tasting ALL the chocolate. Milk, dark, you name it—I sampled it. I even made my own chocolate bar. It was like Willy Wonka’s factory, but without the weird Oompa-Loompas.

The ride from Lucerne to Interlaken offered unparalleled views of sparkling lakes and dramatic mountain peaks. As the train weaved through lush valleys and rolling meadows, I was constantly in awe of the ever-changing landscape. This journey gave me a true sense of Switzerland&#x27;s natural grandeur, with each turn revealing more spectacular vistas.<br/><br/>Ah, Interlaken—what can I say? The landscape was like someone took all the best views in Switzerland and dropped them into one place. My first stop was <br/><strong>Harder Kulm</strong>, where I got the first of many &quot;breathtaking&quot; views. The observation deck had panoramic views of Interlaken, with the Jungfrau massif towering in the distance. At that point, I knew this was going to be the trip of a lifetime.<p id="13a3ab91-7fac-8055-bbb5-c8aac03d5d7e" class=""><br/>Next, I ventured to <br/><strong><a href="https://www.myswitzerland.com/en-us/destinations/montreux-riviera/">Montreux</a></strong>, a lakeside town with an artsy vibe that was a refreshing change of pace from the mountains.

The train ride was incredibly smooth and offered panoramic windows, allowing me to fully immerse myself in the beauty of the Swiss countryside. As the train glided through rolling hills, charming villages, and lush forests, I felt like I was living in a postcard. The journey was an experience in itself, with the changing landscapes—from vineyards to alpine peaks—keeping me captivated throughout. I walked along the lakeside promenade, surrounded by beautiful flower gardens, with views of snow-capped peaks in the distance. And then there was <strong><a href="https://www.myswitzerland.com/en-us/experiences/chillon-castle/">Château de Chillon</a></strong>, a medieval castle on Lake Geneva. This castle isn’t just beautiful; it’s steeped in history.

Gstaad is known for luxury,and if you grew up in India as a ‘90s kid, these places might feel familiar thanks to Bollywood films like <em>Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge</em> (DDLJ). I also learned that Yash Chopra, the legendary director behind DDLJ, is an ambassador for Interlaken, thanks to the region&#x27;s popularity with Indian honeymooners due to the multiple movies he has shot there.<br/><br/></p><p id="13a3ab91-7fac-8049-b1ae-e9b85fe4d7cc" class=""><strong><a href="https://www.jungfrau.ch/en-gb/grindelwaldfirst/">Grindelwald First</a></strong><a href="https://www.jungfrau.ch/en-gb/grindelwaldfirst/"> </a>was one the highlights of this region. I hiked to <strong>Bachalpsee Lake </strong>with some people I met at my hostel in Interlaken, where the mountain reflections in the still waters were mesmerizing. Then, I descended the mountain on a <strong>Trottibike</strong>, a fun and exhilarating way to end the hike. </p><p id="13a3ab91-7fac-80d8-99d3-f3fa3676157d" class="">For a calmer day, I made my way to <strong>Oeschinensee</strong>, an unbelievably beautiful lake surrounded by cliffs and forests. The hike was peaceful, and I made plenty of stops just to soak in the surroundings. Honestly, nature’s version of therapy. I also rode the famous mountain coaster. The coaster closed as it had rained a few hours ago but I somehow convinced the person on duty to allow me given there was no one in that area and everything was almost on the verge of drying. <br/><br/></p><p id="13a3ab91-7fac-804e-8c43-e7d8c860d228" class=""><strong><a href="https://www.myswitzerland.com/en-us/destinations/lauterbrunnen/">Lauterbrunnen Valley</a></strong> felt like a hidden paradise.

I also visited <strong>Mürren</strong>, <strong>Gimmelwald</strong>, and <strong>Wengen</strong>, each village offering its own unique alpine charm. Mürren, with its car-free streets and cozy chalets, was particularly peaceful, while Wengen&#x27;s lush green landscapes took my breath away.</p><p id="13a3ab91-7fac-8076-970b-c49008ceadd7" class="">On my last day in the region, I experienced the thrill of <strong>paragliding</strong> for the first time in my life.

The car-free village at the base of the iconic <strong>Matterhorn</strong>, has an incredible charm, with its quaint wooden chalets and bustling streets filled with cozy cafes, shops, and lively après-ski spots.

This unforgettable  trail takes you past five stunning alpine lakes. The fall colors were in full swing, painting the landscape with hues of gold, amber, and crimson. Every lake had its own character, providing unique reflections of the Matterhorn. <strong>Stellisee</strong>, the first and most iconic lake, stood out as my favorite. The clear waters mirrored the sharp peak of the Matterhorn so perfectly, it felt like a painting.</p><p id="13a3ab91-7fac-80c9-90c1-d1cbe90c7b92" class="">As I walked from <strong>Leisee to </strong> <strong>Stellisee</strong> to <strong>Grindjisee</strong>, <strong>Grünschsee</strong>, the changing scenery kept me captivated. <strong>Grindjisee</strong> was surrounded by larches that had turned brilliant gold, while <strong>Grünschsee</strong> boasted an emerald hue that perfectly complemented the fall foliage. Though I had to skip <strong>Moosjisee (the 5th lake)</strong> due to time constraints, the trail was still an extraordinary journey through vibrant forests, sparkling lakes, and snow-dusted peaks.</p><p id="13b3ab91-7fac-80a7-b3c9-cfdc4440467b" class="">

As a result, the common advice you&#x27;ll hear is to either cook your own meals or pick something up from Migros or Coop, two of the most popular grocery stores in Switzerland.  Though I mostly ate out, the good was decent, though nothing particularly unique relative to the hefty price tag.

Why? Because it had much better connections to Italy, and I was all about making those Florence and Rome plans happen—strike or no strike. Speaking of strikes, Italy had a railway workers’ protest over the weekend, but I decided to power through. After all, if I delayed my trip, I’d have less time in Florence and Rome. That’s like missing out on pasta for a week. Not happening.</p><p id="13b3ab91-7fac-80d6-88fa-eff026698313" class="">On the way, I bumped into the couple from Punjab again. Turns out they were headed to Milan for a Diljit Dosanjh concert before making their way to Florence and Rome, so we got to bond over travel mishaps. But then, the real fun began when we hit Italy.</p><p id="13b3ab91-7fac-8052-a8d1-e9cdb91bfe4c" class="">Thanks to the strike, we were forced to catch a bus to our destination. Simple enough, right? Well, our train from Brig was delayed by 10-15 minutes, and just like that, we missed the bus. Classic. The staff had no clue when the next train would show up. In fact, even five minutes before departure, no one could tell if a train was coming. But here’s the silver lining: there were a bunch of other travelers in the same boat—people from all over the world, united in our confusion and impatience. We formed a sort of international solidarity group, sharing advice, and ultimately making it through together. After some more delays, we finally managed to catch a train, then hopped onto a bus to Milan. From there, we all scattered to our respective destinations, each one of us with a new chapter in our “How I Survived the Italian Strike” story.</p><h3 id="13b3ab91-7fac-80c4-83d7-deca3bfa01e4" class="">More Pictures:-</h3><figure id="13b3ab91-7fac-801a-a7ad-c3e2c3001e86"><div class="source"><a href="https://europe2024-b3705e.gitlab.io/Switzerland/gallery/">https://europe2024-b3705e.gitlab.io/Switzerland/gallery/</a></div></figure><p id="13b3ab91-7fac-8097-a1d4-f146bfd2cefd" class="">

Inside, the dome’s frescoes by Giorgio Vasari, depicting the Last Judgment, were a stunning sight. It’s like standing inside a masterpiece.</p><p id="13b3ab91-7fac-80c3-bd3e-fcc30c7cb573" class="">In Florence, I booked a combo tour of the <strong>Uffizi Gallery</strong> and <strong>Accademia Gallery</strong> with <strong>The Tour Guy</strong>. As luck would have it, I couldn’t get last-minute tickets for the Uffizi, so this tour turned out to be a lifesaver. I skipped the lines, avoided the crowds, and got some expert insights into some of the world’s most renowned masterpieces.We kicked off the tour at the <strong>Accademia Gallery</strong>, home to Michelangelo’s <strong>David</strong>, which left me speechless. Standing over 17 feet tall, David’s anatomy is incredibly precise. From the tension in his stance to the intense expression on his face, every detail, including his veins, muscles, and the strain in his right hand, feels lifelike and breathtaking. Our guide took us through the significance of this work, tying it back to Florence’s rich history, which made the experience even more profound. The gallery also houses Michelangelo’s <strong>Prisoners (or Slaves)</strong> series, sculptures that look like they’re still trapped in their marble shells, desperately trying to break free.</p><p id="13b3ab91-7fac-80de-a74e-dcfa10c80d81" class="">Next, we headed to the <strong>Uffizi Gallery</strong>, where I was blown away by masterpieces from <strong>Botticelli</strong>, <strong>Leonardo da Vinci</strong>, <strong>Michelangelo</strong>, and others. The guide led us to Botticelli’s <strong>The Birth of Venus</strong> and <strong>Primavera</strong>, both of which were jaw-dropping in person—colors so vivid, it felt like they could come to life at any moment. Da Vinci’s <strong>Annunciation</strong> was another highlight, with its groundbreaking use of perspective. Without the tour, the Uffizi’s massive collection could’ve been overwhelming, but our guide made sure we didn’t miss the key gems. Exploring the Uffizi and Accademia galleries without worrying about tickets or long lines made the experience feel like an intimate journey through the heart of the Renaissance. Florence’s art treasures came alive, and I left with a deeper appreciation for this artistic cradle of Europe.

The train ride was easy, and before I knew it, I was standing in <strong>Piazza dei Miracoli</strong>, the beautiful square where the tower leans in all its glory. The tower is even more impressive in person, with its iconic tilt really standing out against the Tuscan sky. I decided not to climb it but enjoyed admiring the intricate details on each of its tiers. The square was full of people, many of them posing for photos, pretending to hold up the tower.

This colossal amphitheater, which once hosted gladiator fights, mock naval battles, and public spectacles, was awe-inspiring. As I walked through its massive arches and onto the arena floor, I could almost hear the roar of the crowds. Standing there, surrounded by centuries of history, I marveled at how much of the Colosseum had survived earthquakes and looting. It’s a reminder of Rome’s architectural genius and might.</p><p id="13b3ab91-7fac-8089-abf8-c907a74f827d" class=""><strong>Roman Forum and Palatine Hill</strong></p><p id="13b3ab91-7fac-80fc-8e76-f65c50d696e8" class="">Just a short walk from the Colosseum, the <strong>Roman Forum</strong> and <strong>Palatine Hill</strong> offer a fascinating glimpse into ancient Roman life. The Forum is filled with ruins of government buildings, temples, and statues, each with its own story. At Palatine Hill, where Rome’s elite once lived, I explored the <strong>House of Augustus</strong>, the residence of Rome’s first emperor. The frescoes on the walls, still vibrant after all these years, told stories of power, wealth, and a civilization.</p><p id="13b3ab91-7fac-8029-8a40-df5a89f023c6" class="">The <strong>Pantheon</strong> was another jaw-dropping marvel. Its massive dome and central oculus, which lets in light to illuminate the interior, made me feel small in the best possible way. It’s one of the world’s largest unreinforced concrete domes, and it’s easy to see why—every detail is a testament to Roman engineering at its finest.</p><p id="13b3ab91-7fac-8079-b935-e126e2df6be9" class="">Finally, no visit to Rome would be complete without a stop at the <strong>Trevi Fountain</strong>. Even though the fountain was fenced due to it being under construction when I visited, people still took part in the tradition of tossing a coin. It’s said to guarantee a return to Rome, and I’m holding out hope that it works.</p><p id="13b3ab91-7fac-80a9-8f11-e2c3e379ab3d" class="">When in Rome, a trip to <strong>Vatican City</strong> is a must. Despite not being a Christian, I was deeply moved by the art, architecture, and history that fill this tiny independent country. <strong>St. Peter’s Basilica</strong> is breathtaking, and climbing to the top of the dome offered panoramic views of both Vatican City and Rome. Inside, Michelangelo’s <strong>Pietà</strong> and Bernini’s <strong>Baldachin</strong> were awe-inspiring, and the entire church felt like a living museum of religious art and history.</p><p id="13b3ab91-7fac-805c-b90e-faa4f2401b5e" class="">Rome’s food was a revelation. I tried <strong>Cacio e Pepe</strong> and <strong>Carbonara</strong>, two classic Roman pasta dishes that are all about simplicity and bold flavors. The Pecorino Romano cheese, fresh pasta, and black pepper in these dishes were incredible. Of course, I couldn’t resist the gelato and tiramisu—pistachio and hazelnut became my go-to flavors. And speaking of tiramisu, there’s a place called <strong><a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/rK7WhAmJenQPfUb48">Two Sizes</a></strong> that serves the best tiramisu I’ve ever had. I went back 6 times. Seriously, you can skip anything else in Rome but don’t skip this place. I had at least two cups per visit.</p></li></ul><p id="13b3ab91-7fac-800e-a034-fc5237b7f575" class="">

</p><p id="13b3ab91-7fac-8044-94cc-d57b1a71362e" class="">During my 24-hour layover in Istanbul on the way back to Seattle, I took advantage of <strong>Tour Istanbul</strong> to explore some of the city&#x27;s most iconic sites.  First, we wandered through the bustling <strong>Grand Bazaar</strong>, where the colorful stalls were packed with everything from spices to jewelry. Next, we visited the awe-inspiring <strong>Hagia Sophia</strong>, a blend of Byzantine and Ottoman architecture, followed by the serene <strong>Blue Mosque</strong>, its blue tiles, grand domes, and towering minarets make it one of the most recognized structures in the world. In the morning I went inside Hagia Sophia. Here is a tip (originally by my colleague in Amsterdam office), if you even slightly look like Muslim, you can go through the prayer area, avoiding the entrance fee. The prayer area has better views than the visitor section.</p><p id="13b3ab91-7fac-807c-ba8b-edd6e416ce00" class="">The highlight of the day was dinner at <strong>Sarnic Restaurant </strong>[not part of Tour Istanbul], set in a restored Byzantine cistern. The traditional <strong>meze</strong> platters, savory kebabs, and sweet <strong>baklava</strong> were paired with live Turkish music and a captivating belly dance performance. It was the perfect way to experience Istanbul’s rich history, culture, and cuisine in just one day.</p><h1 id="13b3ab91-7fac-8097-bbf1-db336438cf01" class="">📝 Reflections</h1><p id="13b3ab91-7fac-8016-ab77-d2552abf8dbe" class="">Europe proved to be an ideal starting point for my first solo travel experience. For Europeans, it offers a mix of familiar yet diverse landscapes, cultures, and histories. For someone like me, hailing from North America, it was striking how easy it was to travel between countries, where everything felt just a short distance away.</p><p id="13b3ab91-7fac-8020-9597-f9e12c19b3d9" class="">In today’s world, we often carry an automatic barrier around us, driven by a culture of suspicion. Living in a large metropolitan city like Seattle and having travelled to many places, I’m no stranger to keeping my guard up in everyday life. While it’s important to stay aware when traveling alone, I quickly realized there were moments when I had to trust strangers. And, surprisingly, those moments were more rewarding than I expected. </p><p id="13b3ab91-7fac-8061-9ef3-e6054b4b7dd9" class="">A common concern for first-time solo travelers is loneliness, and it was one of mine too. But instead of feeling isolated, I found myself embracing the freedom of being in full control of my schedule. I could move at my own pace, change plans on a whim, and, most importantly, I learned to enjoy my own company once again. Of course, you’re never truly alone. Along the way, I met many other solo and family travelers. I crossed paths with amazing travelers from diverse backgrounds and different stages of life—people from Germany, Portugal, Mexico, Chile, Iran,  Pakistan, Philippines, Argentina, South Korea, Japan, China the United States (Florida, Oregon, Arizona, Washington, Idaho), and India (Punjab, West Bengal, Maharashtra, <strong>Karnataka, </strong>Gujarat, Jammu Kashmir). Through them, I gained new perspectives and stories, each one enriching my own journey. We often cooked food together, shared a cup of coffee and visiting places together if our itinerary allowed.  Europe’s well-connected train network made it even easier to travel, taking the stress out of the journey. Once I arrived at my first destination, any initial fears quickly faded. Sure, not everything went according to plan, but those challenges only added to the adventure, reinforcing that things rarely go exactly as expected, and that’s part of the fun.</p><p id="13b3ab91-7fac-801a-bb8e-fc0c8a7ccf74" class="">I didn’t experience a single grand, transformative moment, but rather a series of small, everyday revelations. Each new encounter or quiet moment added another layer to my understanding. Over time, these experiences became ingrained in my memory, like a collection of little lessons tucked away in the recesses of my mind.</p><p id="13b3ab91-7fac-806c-85cb-fd6085af11c6" class="">Reflecting on my recent solo adventure across Europe—from the streets of London to the markets of Istanbul—I’ve learned more than just where to find the best food or check of famous landmarks. Here are the top lessons I took away from my trip.</p><h3 id="13b3ab91-7fac-8035-864b-df8a540a8fef" class="">1. <strong>The Power of Solo Travel</strong></h3><p id="13b3ab91-7fac-80c3-b52d-ca5d8e42fce8" class="">Solo travel is both terrifying and exhilarating, like jumping into a cold pool. You hesitate at first, but once you’re in, you feel empowered. For me, it meant being 100% in control of my agenda, which led to moments of reflection and unexpected joy. I discovered that, while it&#x27;s amazing to be comfortable alone, we all need people—so don’t be afraid to meet strangers along the way.</p><h3 id="13b3ab91-7fac-80cc-88f8-deaf81cc492a" class="">2. <strong>Flexibility is Key</strong></h3><p id="13b3ab91-7fac-8044-a25f-c84d361bbd9c" class="">Plans are great… until they’re derailed. The missed train from Amsterdam to Zurich and the train strike in Italy forced me to change my travel plans on the fly. But instead of stressing, I embraced the adventure, and that flexibility provided by not booking everything in advance, led to some of the most memorable moments of my trip. So, when things go awry, just roll with it. Travel is about embracing spontaneity, not perfection.</p><h3 id="13b3ab91-7fac-80d9-8a2a-e605a5610455" class="">3. <strong>Prioritize Experiences Over Attractions</strong></h3><p id="13b3ab91-7fac-80aa-99c8-ea6fc2b2ba01" class="">I used to think ticking off famous landmarks was the goal. Then I found myself wandering through Montmartre, Paris, or hiking through Swiss valleys, and realized: the best moments are the unplanned ones. Sure, the Colosseum is amazing, but so is a random café in Rome where you go out and chat with the girl you met at the hostel learning about her experience from moving from Kolkata to Berlin. Sometimes, the less famous yet highly rated spots can offer the richest experiences. I learned that stepping off the beaten path, whether it’s enjoying a quiet day by a lake in Switzerland or a thrilling paragliding session in Lauterbrunnen, is where the real magic happens.</p><h3 id="13b3ab91-7fac-8071-b19b-dd553d2387b6" class="">4. <strong>Travel Smart to Save Money</strong></h3><p id="13b3ab91-7fac-806f-b9ce-e688ea6161e3" class="">Europe isn’t cheap, but it doesn’t have to break the bank. The Swiss Half Fare Card and the Berner Oberland Pass saved me loads on transportation, and hostels and local eateries kept my budget in check. The Eurail Global Flex Pass also helped me avoid paying through the nose for last-minute train tickets. Though I did not have a budget, who knew savings could feel so satisfying?</p><h3 id="13b3ab91-7fac-80ac-b07b-f2b74a9b2194" class="">5. <strong>Packing Light Makes All the Difference</strong></h3><p id="13b3ab91-7fac-8010-80d2-cb2ae0926808" class="">Traveling with just a carry-on and a laptop bag was a game-changer. I breezed through airports, trains, and buses without lugging around a suitcase. Plus, I discovered the wonders of Merino wool clothing—light, antibacterial, and quick-drying. It’s expensive, but I’m now almost convert. I also realize I can live without 90% of the stuff I thought I “needed.”</p><h3 id="13b3ab91-7fac-80cf-b45a-fab35a25d6fa" class="">6. <strong>Cultural Curiosity Enhances the Journey</strong></h3><p id="13b3ab91-7fac-8085-93ee-e153eb29b778" class="">Every city had its own flavor—literally and figuratively. Whether it was trying new pastas in Italy or exploring the vibrant markets in London, I learned that the culture you immerse yourself in shapes your experience. So yes, gelato in Florence, Two Sizes Tiramisu in Rome is a must—but also make sure to chat with the locals and learn about their stories.</p><h3 id="13b3ab91-7fac-8067-858c-ca73bedc84d3" class="">7. <strong>Take Time to Reflect and Be Present</strong></h3><p id="13b3ab91-7fac-800c-8e16-cbe0ab75f83b" class="">With so much to see, it’s easy to rush from one attraction to the next. But I found that some of the most rewarding moments were the ones I slowed down for: sitting in Luxembourg Gardens, quietly observing, or gazing at the Matterhorn in Zermatt. Being present, even for a few minutes, gave my trip a deeper sense of meaning.</p><h3 id="13b3ab91-7fac-80c9-a235-c66c3cc913e2" class="">8. <strong>Embrace Walking and Local Transportation</strong></h3><p id="13b3ab91-7fac-8033-9218-c294928966d1" class="">In the U.S., I’d always rent a car to explore a new city [unless its New York City], but in Europe, walking and using local transport was key. The trams in Amsterdam and trains in Switzerland weren’t just convenient; they allowed me to experience the city like a local. Plus, I got to skip the whole “I can’t find parking” stress—win-win!</p><hr id="13b3ab91-7fac-8044-a6e5-c6cb960f4d5e"/><p id="13b3ab91-7fac-8081-a1e4-d12227a97ce0" class="">In the end, my trip wasn’t just about ticking off landmarks, but about embracing change, connecting with people, and learning more about myself along the way. Above all, I valued the freedom solo travel offered. The freedom to decide whether to stay or go, to move or pause. I had the liberty to shape my experience without compromise, and that was incredibly empowering.</p><p id="13b3ab91-7fac-80df-b5ac-cb635af2cc60" class="">Traveling alone also taught me to trust people, and I found that, time and again, people did not let me down. More importantly, I learned to trust myself—my instincts and my ability to navigate any situation that came my way. I rediscovered the things that truly bring me joy: spontaneous conversations with strangers, physically challenging yet rewarding days, singing on bike rides through unfamiliar streets, and savoring simple roadside meals. These small pleasures were more fulfilling than I could have imagined.</p><p id="13b3ab91-7fac-8016-a861-ce1bce41cc16" class="">The people I met along the way left a lasting impact on me, each encounter adding depth to my journey. In hindsight, this trip was a chance to break free from my routine and step outside my well-established habits. And I’m grateful for it, because now I understand more clearly than ever why I need those routines back in my life. I’ll be carrying these lessons with me for a life.</p><p id="13b3ab91-7fac-801e-870b-f18918542c3d" class="">
